        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>This app is intended for use as a supplemental revision aid in your preparation for the Science exam. 
            It should be used alongside the practice questions provided in the training notes and in 
            consultation with your Tutor.</p>
            
        <h4>Instructions For Use</h4>
        <p>Choose a button from the left column for the subject you wish to revise. Each click will create 
            a new sum. Once you have completed your answer on paper, click the ‘solution’ button to see a 
            full, worked solution. A counter within the Solution button shows the number of times 
            the solution has been viewed.</p>
            
        <h4>Link To Training Notes</h4>
        <p>Under each question, a link is provided which will take you to the relevant area of the training notes.</p>
            
        <h4>Vectors</h4>
        <p>Produces various different vector drawing exercises. In each case, use the specified type of scale 
            drawing to solve the problem. Remember, these questions must be solved by scale drawing, not trigonometry. 
            While the 'solution' is visible, a 'show me how' button will also be available which will run an animation 
            showing how the diagram is constructed.</p>
          
        <h4>Moments / CofG</h4>
        <p>This button randomly produces either a question requiring you to find the centre of gravity of an aircraft 
            or a pivoted beam to be put into a state of equilibrium.</p>
          
        <h4>All other buttons</h4>
        <p>Each button produces various problems on the related topic. In each case, the 'solution' button gives 
            a worked solution.</p>
